## Getting Super Powers

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process:

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

```
In eWizard v1.17.0 we have fixed some issues, as well as added new functionality.

So, with eWizard v1.17.0 you can publish emails to Viseven CRM, publish e-Detailers to Adobe Experience Manager, set up custom fields when you are publishing content to CT Presenter, and search assets by various parameters in Veeva Vault Digital Assets.

Veeva Vault users can now edit Veeva presentations in eWizard.

In Editor here comes the possibility to enter text vertically to facilitate Japan localization.
