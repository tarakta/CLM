<h3 id="website-overview">Website Overview</h3>
<p>First, log in to website. You will see the <strong>e-Detailers</strong> gallery. Most likely, it is empty as of now. Later you will add e-Detailers there, but first let’s take a glance at eWizard structure and sections.</p>
<p>Unfold the <em>menu</em> (<img src="https://visevengroup-my.sharepoint.com/:i:/r/personal/t_khodorovskaya_viseven_com/Documents/Screenshots%20Technical%20Writing/FAQ/011_menu.png?csf=1&amp;e=weLTm6" alt="enter image description here">) item in the top left corner of the page. It is the way to reach all Platform’s sections. It is split into <strong>Content</strong> and <strong>Services</strong>. Content includes: <strong>e-Detailers</strong> (it is where you are now), <strong>Email Templates</strong> (where you can elaborate your perfect emails), <strong>Call Flows</strong> (here you can combine slides from several presentations), <strong>Digital Assets</strong> (where all your media files are stored), <strong>Surveys</strong> (use them for educational purposes, for example), <strong>Microsites</strong> (to present your products).</p>
<p><strong>Services</strong>  means actions with your created content. The <strong>Global Store</strong> is a content repository, where you can share your content with colleagues. Although  generally <strong>NaviGate</strong> is the same as the Global Store, it is much more user-friendly, features handy and rich functionality  – simply  put, it is made for people to work with content, not only for tech geeks. <strong>eWizard Pulse</strong> is an online extension for our CLM application, where you can view presentations published to Pulse CLM and access its analytics. <strong>Components</strong> is a gallery where you and your colleagues share media for content creation. Finally, <strong>Reviews</strong> is a service where you can track the content approval process.</p>
<p>At the top of the page you have probably noticed <strong>Owner</strong>, <strong>Country</strong>  and  <strong>Language</strong>. These dropdowns are meant for the content sorting (if, or better, when there are any). Shift glance to the right, and you will find <strong>Search</strong> (to search the content), and three (or four, if you are an administrator) tiny images. They are, accordingly: <em>admin panel</em> (if you are seeing four images), <em>help center</em>, <em>notifications</em>, and <em>your account</em>. Under your account you can track custom requests, but let’s don’t run before we can walk.</p>
<h3 id="content-creation">Content Creation</h3>
<p>Generally, the content creation flow looks as follows:<br>
<img src="https://visevengroup-my.sharepoint.com/:i:/r/personal/t_khodorovskaya_viseven_com/Documents/Screenshots%20Technical%20Writing/FAQ/content-creation-flow.png?csf=1&amp;e=8lJ5W1" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>However, depending on the content type, some steps of this flow may change. To illustrate the process more precisely, let’s take an e-Detailer as this channel features the fullest set of options.</p>
<h3 id="operations-with-e-detailer">Operations with e-Detailer</h3>
<p>To create an e-Detailer, go to e-Detailers, click <strong>ADD NEW</strong> and select the required: <strong>Create New</strong> to create an e-Detailer based on one of the templates available, <strong>Upload From</strong> to upload an e-Detailer from your device (if it have been created in eWizard previously), or <strong>Conversion</strong> to convert a PDF file to the HTML5 presentation (which is a format for presentations in eWizard). Regardless of the way you choose, you must set the name of your e-Detailer, the country it is intended for, language, and a target device. Target device impacts the dimensions of your presentation, depending on the device’s screen.</p>
<p>After you have created a template, look at its bottom bar. It contains the following options:<br>
<img src="https://visevengroup-my.sharepoint.com/:i:/r/personal/t_khodorovskaya_viseven_com/Documents/Screenshots%20Technical%20Writing/FAQ/bottom%20edetailer%20bar.png?csf=1&amp;e=3RZDnN" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>You might need to personalize or otherwise edit your created e-Detailer. For this purpose, click <strong>Edit</strong> and make the required changes. If you want to add or remove slides or chapters, or to make any chapters hidden/visible, go to its <strong>Structure</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Details</strong> contains precise information about your e-Detailer, including versions (each time you save your presentation in <em>Editor</em>, it appears as a version under <strong>Details</strong>), sharing settings, exports, applications, documents, share links, and publications history.</p>
<p>Next, you need to approve your e-Detailer. You can do it via <strong>More options</strong>. Select <strong>Send for Review</strong> and specify a reviewer’s email. The e-Detailer will be sent to them for approval. You can track the review history under <strong>Reviews</strong>.</p>
<p>Besides, eWizard allows easy localization. Open <strong>More options</strong> of the required e-Detailer, click <strong>Create Localization</strong>, then specify the <strong>Country</strong> and <strong>Language</strong> for the localization. Then e-Detailer’s  copy prepared for localization will appear in the <em>Gallery</em>. If you unfold <strong>More options</strong> of this created copy and select <strong>Localize</strong> there, you will notice one more option have appeared, <strong>Edit Localization</strong>. Click it to open the localization editor. You can enter the translations right there or send it to a translator or translation services agency. Moreover, eWizard allows exporting it in .xlsx format and importing the translation. Don’t forget to save you localization, if you decide to localize your e-Detailer right on this page.</p>
<p>For collaborative work, use <strong>Share link</strong>. Every time you share an e-Detailer with your colleagues, it is registered, and the shared version can be found under <strong>Sharing Settings</strong> in <strong>Details</strong>.</p>
<p>Finally, when e-Detailer is polished, you must send it to a target system for proper use. So, open <strong>More options</strong> again and find either <strong>Export</strong> or <strong>Publish</strong>. Their objective points are the same: to dispatch your e-Detailer to a place from where it can be demonstrated to the audience. The difference is that <strong>Export</strong> requires more manual operation, while <strong>Publish</strong> is automated to the fullest extent possible.  Thus, <strong>Export</strong> includes three options: <strong>CLM</strong>, <strong>Documents</strong>, and <strong>Applications</strong>. It’s up to you to select the appropriate one. CLM  creates a so-called <em>build</em> for upload to your target system with further use via a CLM application.  Select <strong>Documents</strong> to download your e-Detailer in the .pdf format. <strong>Applications</strong> creates a standalone application for installing on a portable device. Unlike <strong>Export</strong>, <strong>Publish</strong> automatically  places individually configured build to a chosen target system omitting the download step (and thus minimizes human operation). One more option to land an e-Detailer file to your device is to <strong>Download Source</strong> (again, via <strong>More options</strong>). In such instance you get a presentation as it is, in eWizard compatible format. Use it, for example, for further upload back to eWizard.</p>
